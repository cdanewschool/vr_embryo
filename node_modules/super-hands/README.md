## Description

The `super-hands` component interprets input from controls and
collision detection components
into interaction gestures and communicates those gestures to
target entities for them to respond.  

The currently implemented gestures are:

* Hover: Holding a controller in the collision space of an entity
* Grab: Pressing a button while hovering an entity, potentially also moving it
* Stretch: Grabbing an entity with two hands and resizing
* Drag-drop: Dragging an entity onto another entity

For an entity to respond to the `super-hands` gestures, it needs to have
components attached to translate the gestures into actions. `super-hands`
includes components for typical reactions to the implemented gestures:
`hoverable`, `clickable`, `grabbable`, `stretchable`, `draggable`, and
`droppable`.

**Universal Progressive Controls**: The `progressive-controls` component
provides consistent interactivity on any viewer from desktop to full
6-DOF virtual reality by auto-detecting viewer capabilities.

**Avatar Locomotion**: Inspired by a demo from [@caseyyee](https://github.com/caseyyee), the `super-hands`
grab and stretch gestures can also serve as a comfortable locomotion system
by moving and scaling the world around the player. Use the `a-locomotor` primitive
to provide intuitive freedom of motion in your WebVR experiences.

## Core, primitives, and meta-components

### super-hands component

The `super-hands` component is the core of the library.
It communicates gesture events to entities based on
user-input and entity collisions. The component is generally placed on
the controller entities (or the camera for gaze interaction) and depends on
a collision detection component (e.g. `raycaster`, [aframe-extras sphere-collider](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/misc),
of [aframe-physics-extras physics-collider](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-physics-extras))
which needs to be placed on the same entity or a child entity of `super-hands`.

#### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| colliderEvent | Event that your chosen collider emits when identifying a new collision | `'hit'` |
| colliderEventProperty | Name of property in event `detail` object which contains the collided entity | `'el'` |
| colliderEndEvent | Event that your chosen collider emits when a collision ends | `'hitEnd'` |
| colliderEndEventProperty | Name of property in event `detail` object which contains the un-collided entity | `'el'` |
| grabStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate grab | Button press, touch start, and mouse down events |
| grabEndButtons | Array of button event types that can terminate grab | Button release, touch end, and mouse up events |
| stretchStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate stretch | Button press, touch start, and mouse down events |
| stretchEndButtons | Array of button event types that can terminate stretch | Button release, touch end, and mouse up events |
| dragDropStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate dragging/hovering | Button press, touch start, and mouse down events |
| dragDropEndButtons | Array of button event types that can execute drag-drop | Button release, touch end, and mouse up events |

Collider-related property defaults are set to work with `sphere-collider`.
Default button events include specific events for `vive-controls`,
`hand-controls`, `oculus-touch-controls`, `daydream-controls`,
`gearvr-controls`, mouse, and touch. For detecting when collisions end,
either `colliderState` or `colliderEndEvent`/`colliderEndEventProperty` can be
used, depending on the API of the collider in use.

#### Gesture Events

Events will be emitted by the entity being interacted with.
The entity that `super-hands` is attached to is sent in the event `detail` as the property `hand`.

| Type | Description | Target |  detail object |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hover-start | Collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| hover-end | No longer collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| grab-start | Button pressed while collided with entity and hand is empty | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| grab-end | Button released after grab-start | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| stretch-start | Both controllers have button pressed while collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, secondHand: second controller entity |
| stretch-end | Release of button after stretch-start | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| drag-start | Drag-drop button pressed while collided with entity and hand is empty | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| drag-end | Drag-drop button released while dragging an entity | dragged entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| dragover-start | Collision with entity while dragging another entity | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, hovered: collided entity, carried: held entity |
| dragover-end | No longer collided with entity from dragover-start | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, hovered: collided entity, carried: held entity |
| drag-drop | Button released while holding an entity and collided with another | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, dropped: carried entity, on (carried entity only): receiving entity |

Notes:

* References to buttons being "released" and "pressed" are dependent on the schema settings.
* Only one entity at a time will be targeted for each event type,
even if multiple overlapping collision zones exist. `super-hands` tracks a
LIFO stack of collided entities to determine which will be affected.
* drag-drop: For the receiving entity, `on` entry in the detail is `null`.
If needed, use `event.target` instead.
* For events triggered by buttons, the triggering button event is passed
  along in `detail.buttonEvent`

#### Global Event Handler Integration

In addition to the A-Frame style gesture events,
`super-hands` also causes standard HTML events analogous to VR
interactions to be emitted by the target entities. This allows the use of these
common Global Event Handler properties on entities to add reaction directly
in the HTML. View the
[related example](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/#events)
to see this in use.

| entity HTML attribute | conditions | event.relatedTarget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| onmouseover | hovering in an entity's collision zone | `super-hands` entity |
| onmouseout | leaving an entity's collision zone | `super-hands` entity |
| onmousedown | grab started while collided with entity | `super-hands` entity |
| onmouseup | grab ended while collided with entity | controller entity |
| onclick | grab started and then ended while collided with entity | controller entity |
| ondragstart | drag-drop started while collided with entity | controller entity |
| ondragend | drag-drop started while collided with entity | controller entity |
| ondragenter | hovering in an entity's collision zone while drag-dropping another entity | the other entity\* |
| ondragleave | leaving an entity's collision zone while drag-dropping another entity | the other entity\* |
| ondrop | drag-drop ended while holding an entity over a target | the other entity\* |

The event passed to the handler will be a `MouseEvent`. At present the only property implemented
is `relatedTarget`, which is set as
listed in the table. Drag-dropping events will be dispatched on both the entity being dragged and the drop target, and the `relatedTarget` property for each will point to the other entity in the interaction.

### progressive-controls component

The `progressive-controls` component makes it easy to design an interactive
A-Frame scene that will work on any device. It automatically detects the viewing
device, creates appropriate controller entities, and configures `super-hands`
to work with the device. It is progressive because the degree of interactivity
increases from gaze-based cursors (desktop, mobile, cardboard), to laser pointer
controls (GearVR, Daydream), to natural hand interaction (Vive, Oculus).

#### Usage

Add `progressive-controls` to an entity, and it will create appropriate
controller and camera entities as children automatically.

```html
<a-entity progressive-controls></a-entity>
```

#### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| maxLevel | Limit the highest interactivity level that will be activated: `'gaze'`, `'point'`, or `'touch'`. | `'touch'` |
| gazeMixin | String. Id of `a-mixin` to add to raycaster/cursor entity in gaze mode | `''` |
| pointMixin | String. Id of `a-mixin` to add to raycaster/cursor entity in point mode | `''` |
| touchMixin | String. Id of `a-mixin` to add to raycaster/cursor entity in touch mode | `''` |
| override | Whether to merge specified mixins with default settings (`false`) or to use only properties included in the specified mixin (`true`) | `false` |
| objects | CSS selector string to be used by any automatically generated collision detectors (ignored when overriding). | `''` (all entities) |
| controllerModel | Whether to load default controller models | `true` |

#### Events

| Type | Description |  detail object |
| --- | --- | --- |
|'controller-progressed' | The detected controller type has changed | `level`: new control type, : `'gaze'`, `'point'`, or `'touch'`; `hand`: `'left'` or `'right'`  |

#### Customization

For most cases, using mixin properties is sufficient to add components
or change the defaults that `progressive-controls` sets on the
controllers and cursor. If you need to completely avoid a component that
would normally be added, set the `override` flag, but beware that this skips
all of the default components so you will need to include the `super-hands`
configuration and the raycaster or collider (e.g. the
[physics example](/examples/physics/index.html)
replaces the default collider with a different component).
If you need to change to change or add entities,
you can manually create the player avatar structure using classes to tag
the controller and raycaster entities for `progressice-controls` (e.g., the
[Global Event Handlers example](examples/events/index.html)
adds children to the controllers and raycaster). The complete
default configuration created by `progressive-controls` is below
for reference.

```html
<a-assets>
  <a-mixin id="progressivecontrolsgazedefault" position="0 0 -0.5" raycaster
      geometry="primitive: ring;radiusOuter: 0.008; radiusInner: 0.005; segmentsTheta: 32"
      material="color: #000; shader: flat"
      super-hands="colliderEvent:raycaster-intersection;
                   colliderEventProperty:els;
                   colliderEndEvent:raycaster-intersection-cleared;
                   colliderEndEventProperty:el;">
  </a-mixin>
  <a-mixin id="progressivecontrolspointdefault" raycaster="showLine:true"
       super-hands="colliderEvent:raycaster-intersection;
                    colliderEventProperty:els;
                    colliderEndEvent:raycaster-intersection-cleared;
                    colliderEndEventProperty:el;">
  </a-mixin>
  <a-mixin id="progressivecontrolstouchdefault" super-hands sphere-collider>
  </a-mixin>
</a-assets>
<a-entity progressive-controls>
  <a-camera>
    <a-entity class="gazecaster"></a-entity>
  </a-camera>
  <a-entity class="right-controller"></a-entity>
  <a-entity class="left-controller"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

### a-locomotor primitive

Add freedom of movement by wrapping the player avatar in an `a-locomotor`
primitive.
Users can then grab and move the world around themselves to navigate your
WebVR experience
in a way that is comfortable even for most people prone to simulation sickness.

The component works by wrapping the player in an entity that responds to
grabbing and stretching
gestures made on empty space and translates those into
movement and scaling for player avatar.
To function, the player camera and controllers must be children
of `a-locomotor`.
On initialization, `a-locomotor` will automatically set the default camera
as a child unless it has been declared elsewhere
(see schema below if you want to disable this), so
setting up `a-locomotor` simply requires wrapping your controller
entities like so:

```html
<a-locomotor>
  <a-entity hand-controls="left" super-hands></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="right" super-hands></a-entity>
</a-locomotor>
```

`a-locomotor` does not require a collision detection component to function, so,
if the only `super-hands` functionality you need is locomotion, you do
not need to include `sphere-collider` components on your controllers
(as in the above example).
By default, `a-locomotor` gives the player the ability to move freely in the
horizontal plane and to scale up or down.
Behavior can be customized by setting the attributes below on the `a-locomotor`
entity.

#### Primitive Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| fetch-camera | Make the default camera a child of `a-locomotor` so it can be moved with the player | `true` |
| allow-movement | Allow grabbing gestures to reposition the player | `true` |
| horizontal-only | Restrict movement to the X-Z plane | `true` |
| allow-scaling | Allow stretching gestures to rescale the player | `true` |

#### Events

| Type | Description | Target | Bubbles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 'locomotor-ready' | All auto-configuration steps complete | `a-locomotor` | yes |

## Reaction Components

Add these components to entities in your scene to make them react to
super-hands gestures.

### hoverable component

Used to indicate when the controller is within range to interact with an entity
by adding the 'hovered' state. When using a mixin, including another mixin
in the assets withe same id + '-hovered' will activate automatically, as in
[the examples](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/).

#### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| hovered | Added to entity while it is collided with the controller |


### grabbable component

Makes and entity move along with the controller's movement and rotation
while it is grabbed. `grabbable` works with
up-close grabbing (6DOF controllers like Vive and Oculus Touch
with `hand-controls` and `sphere-collider`)
and with pointing at a distance (3DOF controllers like GearVR and Daydream
with `laser-controls`).

This works best with [aframe-physics-system](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system)
to manage grabbed entity movement including position and rotation,
but it will fallback to manual `position` updates
(without rotation) if physics is not available
or is disabled with `usePhysics = never`.

Allows for multiple hands to register a grab on an entity.
In a non-physics setup, this has no effect
other than allowing smooth passing of entities between hands.
With physics enabled, additional grabbing
hands register their own physics constraints to allow for
two-handed wielding of entities. Limit or disable this
by setting the maxGrabbers schema property.

#### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| startButtons | Which button events to accept to start grab | `[]` |
| endButtons | Which button events to accept to end grab | `[]` |
| usePhysics | Whether to use physics system constraints to handle movement, 'ifavailable', 'only', or 'never' | 'ifavailable' |
| maxGrabbers | Limit number of hands that can grab entity simultaneously | NaN (no limit) |
| invert | Reverse direction of entity movement compared to grabbing hand | false |
| suppressY | Allow movement only in the horizontal plane | false |

The default for `startButtons` and `endButtons` is to accept any button
recognized by `super-hands` `grabStartButtons` and `grabDropEndButtons`.

#### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| grabbed | Added to entity while it is being carried |

### clickable component

An alternative version of `grabbable` that registers that a button was pressed, but does not
move the entity. Do not use `clickable` and `grabbable` on the same entity
(just use `grabbable` and watch the "grabbed" state instead of "clicked")

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| startButtons | Which button events to accept to start grab | `[]` |
| endButtons | Which button events to accept to end grab | `[]` |

The default for `startButtons` and `endButtons` is to accept any button
recognized by `super-hands` `grabStartButtons` and `grabDropEndButtons`.

#### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| clicked | Added to entity while a button is held down |


### stretchable component

Makes and entity rescale while grabbed by both controllers as they are moved closer together or further apart.

#### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| startButtons | Which button events to accept to start stretch | `[]` |
| endButtons | Which button events to accept to end stretch | `[]` |
| usePhysics | Whether to update physics body shapes with scale changes, 'ifavailable' or 'never' | 'ifavailable' |
| invert | Reverse the direction of scaling in relation to controller movement | `false` |

The default for `startButtons` and `endButtons` is to accept any button
recognized by `super-hands` `stretchStartButtons` and `stretchEndButtons`.

There is no CANNON api method for updating physics body scale, but `stretchable` will manually rescale basic shapes. Currently rescalable shapes are: box and sphere.

#### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| stretched | Added to entity while it is grabbed with two hands |

### draggable component

`draggable` makes an entity able to participate in a drag and drop
gesture with a `droppable` entity. This does not move an entity
(also add `grabbable` for that functionality), but instead tracks whether
a gesture has been made that involves pressing a button down with the controller
pointed at this entity, and then moving the controller to point at another
entity with the `droppable` component before releasing.

For interactivity, use the global event handler integration,
the `event-set` from [kframe](http://github.com/ngokevin/kframe)
with the `drag-drop` event, or create your own component.

#### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| startButtons | Which button events to accept to start drag | `[]` |
| endButtons | Which button events to accept to end drag | `[]` |

The default for `startButtons` and `endButtons` is to accept any button
recognized by `super-hands` `dragDropStartButtons` and `dragDropEndButtons`.

#### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dragged | Added to entity from button press until button release |

### droppable component

The `droppable` component sets an entity up as a target to respond to
`dragged` entities. Optionally, it can be configured to accept only
specific entities and to emit custom events on acceptance or rejection.

Combining the `accepts` and `acceptEvent` property of `droppable` with
`event-set` from [kframe](http://github.com/ngokevin/kframe), you can
create rich interactivity without any additional JavaScript or
custom components.

#### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| accepts | CSS query string to specify which entities to respond to | `''` (accept all entities) |
| autoUpdate | Should it watch for newly added entities that match `accepts`? May impact performance. | `true` |
| acceptEvent | String. Name of custom event to emit upon successful drag-drop interaction | `''` (don't emit event) |
| rejectEvent | String. Name of custom event to emit upon rejecting attempted drag-drop that contained an entity not included in `accepts` | `''` (don't emit event) |

Accept and reject events will contain the dragged entity that was accepted/rejected
in the `el` property of `detail`.

#### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dragover | Added to the entity while a controller is holding an acceptable `draggable` entity in the collision space of the `droppable` entity |


## Customizing interactivity

### Gesture and Response Concept

![Separation of Gesture and Response API](readme_files/super-hands-api.png)

Separating the reaction to be the responsibility of the entity affected allows for extensibility.
In response to a grab, you may want some entities to lock to the controller and move,
others to rotate around a fixed point, and others still to spawn a new entity but remain unchanged.
With this API schema, these options can be handled by adding or creating different reaction
components to the entities in your scene, and `super-hands` can work with all of them.

### Interactivity

There are two pathways to adding additional interactivity.

1. A-Frame style: Each component's API documentation describes the A-Frame
custom events and states it uses.
These can be used on conjunction with other community A-Frame components
or by creating custom  components for your project that register
event listeners and react accordingly.
1. HTML style: The `super-hands` component also integrates with the
Global Event Handlers Web API to trigger standard mouse events analogous
to the VR interactions that can easily be handled through
properties like `onclick`.

### Gesture acceptance and rejection

Entities which are the target of gestures communicate back to `super-hands`
that they have accepted the attempted interaction by 'cancelling' the
gesture event (i.e. calling `.preventDefault()` on the event). This allows
`super-hands` to penetrate overlapping and nested entities in order to find
the desired target and for reaction components to be discriminating about
their conditions for interaction
(e.g., [`droppable`](#droppable)). All of the provided
reaction components handle this signaling automatically, but, if you
create your own reaction components, it is important to cancel the events when
responding to a gesture so that `super-hands` knows the gesture has been
accepted and stops searching for a viable target.
