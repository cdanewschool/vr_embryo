# Immersed in Microscopy

The aim of this project is to interface multimodal microscopy images with a VR headset using A-frame.

This is a follow up of [The Embryo Digital Atlas](http://www.embryodigitalatlas.org/), it is funded by the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/first-mini-grant-awards) and hosted at the [Center for Data Arts](http://www.data-arts.nyc/) in New York City and at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) in Rehovot.
